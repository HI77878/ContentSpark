# BLIP-2 Analyzer Fix Summary

## Problem
The BLIP2FactualOptimized analyzer was returning generic instructional text instead of actual video descriptions:
- Example bad output: "For example, a person sleeping in a bed does not provide enough information..."
- This was happening for all frames, making the analyzer useless

## Root Cause
The complex prompt used in BLIP2FactualOptimized was causing the model to generate instructional text:
```python
prompt = (
    "Describe only what is visually present in this image. "
    "Focus on: people (if any), their clothing, objects they hold, "
    "the room or location, and any visible actions. "
    "Be specific and factual. Do not speculate or add context."
)
```

## Solution
Created a new analyzer `blip2_working.py` that uses a simple prompt that works correctly:
```python
prompt = "a photo of"
```

## Results
The fixed analyzer now generates proper descriptions:
- ✅ "a person sleeping in a bed"
- ✅ "a woman brushing her teeth in front of a mirror"
- ✅ "a woman sitting at a desk in front of a window"
- ✅ "a television screen showing people sitting around a table"

## Implementation Details
1. Created `/home/user/tiktok_production/analyzers/blip2_working.py`
2. Updated `ml_analyzer_registry_complete.py` to use `BLIP2Working` instead of `BLIP2FactualOptimized`
3. The analyzer processes 1 frame per second for detailed timeline
4. Uses 8-bit quantization for memory efficiency
5. Generates both individual frame descriptions and a summary

## Performance
- Analyzes 28 frames in ~65 seconds
- Provides second-by-second timeline of video content
- Uses BLIP-2 OPT-2.7B model with 8-bit quantization

## Alternative Approaches Explored
1. **Docker Container (AuroraCap)**: Built Docker container with BLIP-2 but encountered NumPy version conflicts
2. **Complex Prompts**: Tested various complex prompts but they all caused instructional text generation
3. **Simple Prompt**: Found that "a photo of" prompt works reliably

## Next Steps
- The BLIP-2 analyzer is now fixed and integrated into the system
- Can be used via the API at port 8003
- Provides detailed frame-by-frame descriptions for video reconstruction
